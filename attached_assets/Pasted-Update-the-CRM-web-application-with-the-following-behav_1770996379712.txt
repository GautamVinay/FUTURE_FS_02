Update the CRM web application with the following behavior, UI, and analytics enhancements.

1️⃣ Make Loading Screen Last 2–3 Seconds Minimum

Modify the loading/splash screen logic so:

The loading screen stays visible for at least 2–3 seconds, even if the app loads faster.

If backend/API calls take longer, keep it visible until data is ready.

Implement this using:

a minimum timer delay

plus actual loading state

Behavior:

Start timer when app initializes

Wait for:

minimum 2–3 seconds

AND required data to load

Then fade smoothly into login/dashboard

Keep animation smooth and premium.

2️⃣ Add More Dashboard Content (Make CRM Feel Real)

Enhance the dashboard with additional real CRM data panels:

Add cards/widgets for:

Total Clients

Active Deals

Revenue This Month

Pending Tasks

Conversion Rate

Support Tickets Open

Recent Activities feed

Notifications panel

Each card should include:

icon

label

value

small trend indicator (+/− %)

Use glass-style panels.

3️⃣ Upgrade Analytics Page with Real-Time Charts

Enhance the analytics page to include multiple professional charts:

Required Charts

Sales Trend Line Graph

Monthly or weekly trend

Smooth animated line

Revenue Pie Chart

Breakdown by product/service/category

Client Source Bar Chart

Website / Referral / Ads / Direct etc.

Activity Heat or Timeline Graph

Recent CRM actions

All charts must:

animate on load

support real-time updates

be responsive

match theme colors

Use a lightweight chart library suitable for dashboards.

4️⃣ Add Real-Time Data Updates

Simulate or connect to real-time updates:

Numbers on dashboard should update periodically

Charts should animate to new values

Activity feed should append new entries

Use:

WebSockets OR periodic polling

smooth number transitions

animated chart updates

Goal: dashboard feels alive, not static.

5️⃣ Add Animated Graph Background Across Entire App

Add a subtle animated analytics-style background across:

Login page

Dashboard

Analytics page

Design:

thin curved lines representing data flow

small moving nodes/dots along lines

slow movement only

low opacity

non-distracting

Light Mode:

soft blue/purple lines

very faint glow

Dark Mode:

neon blue/teal lines

slightly brighter glow

still subtle

Technical requirements:

Implement using SVG or Canvas animation

Must be GPU-friendly

Must not block interactions

Place behind content with proper z-index

Make it a reusable AnimatedBackground component

6️⃣ Performance Rules

Do not use heavy video or GIF backgrounds

Keep animations smooth at 60fps

Lazy-load charts where possible

Maintain CRM responsiveness
