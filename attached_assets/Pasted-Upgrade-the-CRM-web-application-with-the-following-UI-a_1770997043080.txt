Upgrade the CRM web application with the following UI, animation, dashboard, analytics, and real-time behavior improvements.
All features must be fully implemented — no placeholders.

1️⃣ USE EXISTING REAL-TIME ANIMATED BACKGROUND GLOBALLY

The login page already contains a real-time animated background wallpaper.

Required Change

Reuse that exact existing animated background component

Apply it to the entire CRM:

Dashboard

Analytics page

All main feature pages

Settings/Profile pages

Login page (keep as is)

Implementation Instructions

Do NOT recreate the animation.

Extract it into a reusable component/module.

Wrap the main app layout with it so every page inherits the background.

Ensure it sits behind all UI using proper z-index.

Ensure it does not block inputs, clicks, or scrolling.

Ensure performance remains smooth.

Goal: one consistent animated background across the full product.

2️⃣ LOADING SCREEN WITH MINIMUM DURATION CONTROL

Modify the splash/loading screen:

Behavior

Show immediately on app start.

Remain visible for minimum 2–3 seconds.

If data/API loading takes longer, keep it visible until finished.

Only transition when:

timer finished AND

required data loaded.

Transition

Smooth fade out → fade in app.

Visuals

Center logo

Floating motion (3–4s loop, ease-in-out)

White rounded loading bar with glow

Smooth progress animation

Make this a reusable component.
