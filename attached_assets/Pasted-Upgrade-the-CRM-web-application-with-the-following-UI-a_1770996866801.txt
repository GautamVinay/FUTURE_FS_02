Upgrade the CRM web application with the following UI, animation, dashboard, analytics, and real-time behavior improvements.
All features must be fully implemented, not placeholders.

1️⃣ LOADING SCREEN (WITH MINIMUM DURATION CONTROL)

Modify the splash/loading screen so it behaves professionally:

Behavior

Show loading screen immediately when app starts.

Keep it visible for minimum 2–3 seconds, even if app loads faster.

If API/data loading takes longer, keep it visible until data is ready.

Only transition when BOTH conditions are met:

minimum timer finished

required app data loaded

Transition

Fade out loading screen smoothly.

Fade in login/dashboard.

No abrupt changes.

Visuals

Center logo.

Floating animation (slow vertical motion, 3–4s loop, ease-in-out).

White loading bar below logo:

rounded corners

subtle glow

smooth progress animation

Architecture

Implement as reusable component.

Controlled by global loading state.

2️⃣ GLOBAL REAL-TIME ANIMATED GRAPH BACKGROUND

Add a reusable animated background component used across:

Login page

Dashboard

Analytics page

All main views

Visual Style

Thin curved lines representing data flow

Small glowing nodes moving along lines

Slow continuous motion

Very low opacity so UI remains readable

Must look like abstract analytics activity

Theme Adaptation

Light mode:

soft blue / purple gradient lines

minimal glow

Dark mode:

neon blue / teal glow

slightly stronger brightness

Technical Requirements

Implement using SVG or Canvas animation (not video/GIF)

GPU-friendly animation only

Responsive to screen size

Positioned behind UI with z-index layering

Should never block clicks or inputs

Make it a reusable component.

3️⃣ PREMIUM APPLE-STYLE GLASS UI

Upgrade visual styling across:

Sidebar

Navbar

Dashboard cards

Analytics panels

Forms

Modals

Glass Requirements

Strong backdrop blur

Semi-transparent background layers

Subtle white borders
