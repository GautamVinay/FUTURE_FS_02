Good idea — this will make your CRM look seriously premium, but the prompt needs to be very precise so Replit doesn’t generate something messy or heavy.

Here’s your FULL FINAL REPLIT PROMPT (with animated graph background + everything so far) 👇

🚀 FINAL REPLIT AI PROMPT — PREMIUM CRM UI UPGRADE

Upgrade the CRM web application with the following visual, animation, and admin feature improvements. Focus on performance, smoothness, and a premium SaaS look.

1️⃣ Replace Logo Everywhere

Replace the existing logo across:

Navbar

Sidebar header

Login page

Loading screen

Use the uploaded image file.

Maintain transparency and aspect ratio.

Ensure responsive scaling.

2️⃣ Premium Loading / Splash Screen

Create a reusable loading screen shown before login/dashboard loads.

Requirements:

Same background color as login page.

Center the logo.

Animate logo floating up/down slowly:

Smooth infinite animation

3–4s loop

Ease-in-out

Add white loading bar below logo:

Rounded corners

Soft glow

Smooth animated progress

Fade transition into the app.

3️⃣ Apple-Style Liquid Glass UI Upgrade

Enhance glassmorphism across the CRM:

Apply to:

Sidebar

Navbar

Cards

Modals

Forms

Dashboard panels

Glass styling must include:

Strong backdrop blur

Semi-transparent surfaces

Subtle light borders

Soft inner highlights

Floating shadows

Smooth hover effects

Depth layering between panels

Design goal: Apple iOS / macOS inspired enterprise SaaS look

Avoid flashy animations.

4️⃣ Admin Edit Details Feature

Add a “Edit Details” button in the admin dashboard/profile area.

When clicked:
Open a glass-style modal or page allowing the admin to edit:

Name

Username

Admin Code

Email

Include:

Validation

Save button with success feedback

Cancel button

Responsive layout

Persist changes to backend/database

Make this a reusable component.

5️⃣ Real-Time Animated Graph Background (NEW)

Add a subtle animated background to the dashboard and login page that displays moving abstract data graphs, representing CRM analytics activity.

🎯 Visual Style

Use thin smooth line graphs

Curved paths or wave-like analytics lines

Slowly moving nodes/dots along lines

Subtle glowing points to represent data flow

Must remain faint and non-distracting

This is a background decoration, not an actual chart.

🎨 Light Mode Version

Lines: soft blue / purple gradient

Glow: very subtle

Opacity: low (10–20%)

Background remains clean and readable

🌙 Dark Mode Version

Lines: neon blue / teal / violet glow

Slightly stronger glow than light mode

Still subtle and professional

Do NOT overpower UI elements

⚙️ Behavior Requirements

Graph lines should move slowly horizontally or diagonally.

Dots should flow along the lines continuously.

Animation must be:

Smooth

Infinite loop

GPU-friendly

Lightweight

Automatically switch colors based on light/dark mode.

🧠 Technical Implementation

Use Canvas or SVG animation (not heavy video or GIF).

Must be responsive to screen size.

Keep CPU usage minimal.

Place behind content using z-index layering.

Should not interfere with buttons or inputs.

Create this as a reusable AnimatedBackground component.

6️⃣ Performance & Architecture Rules

All new UI elements must be reusable components.

Keep animations GPU-accelerated.

Avoid heavy libraries unless necessary.

Maintain consistent spacing, typography, and colors.

Preserve existing CRM functionality.

🎯 FINAL GOAL

The CRM should feel like:

A real SaaS product

Premium enterprise software

Apple-level polish
